The goal is to ingest published book content, generate embeddings, and persist them in a vector database to support downstream retrieval and agent-based question answering.\n\nTarget users:\n- Backend engineers implementing the RAG pipeline\n- AI engineers responsible for embeddings and vector storage\n- Project evaluators validating RAG readiness\n\nPrimary objective:\nCreate a reliable, repeatable pipeline that:\n1. Extracts content from deployed Docusaurus website URLs\n2. Chunks and preprocesses the content appropriately for semantic retrieval\n3. Generates vector embeddings using a supported embedding model\n4. Stores embeddings and metadata in Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier)\n5. Enables efficient similarity search for later RAG stages\n\nSuccess criteria:\n- Website content is programmatically fetched from the deployed GitHub Pages URLs\n- Text is cleaned, normalized, and chunked with clear, documented strategy\n- Embeddings are generated using a production-ready embedding model\n- All embeddings are successfully stored in Qdrant with:\n  - Unique IDs\n  - Source URL references\n  - Chunk indices\n  - Optional section/page metadata\n- A sample similarity query against Qdrant returns relevant content\n- Pipeline can be rerun without duplicating or corrupting existing vectors\n\nConstraints:\n- Vector database: Qdrant Cloud Free Tier\n- Embeddings: OpenAI-compatible embedding model\n- Content source: Public Docusaurus site (HTML or Markdown-derived text)\n- Implementation language: Python\n- Execution environment: Local or server-based, non-interactive\n- Must support future incremental updates (new pages or edits)\n\nOut of scope (not building):\n- Retrieval logic or ranking optimization\n- RAG prompt construction\n- Agent orchestration or FastAPI services\n- Frontend integration\n- Authentication, authorization, or user management\" 1 rag-content-ingestion)"
